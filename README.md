# kICS-Confinement-Analysis
This repository includes scripts and Manual for a Matlab based GUI that performs analysis by k-space Image Correlation Spectroscopy on the image time series, to extract diffusion and confinement parameters for a protein of interest. Please consult the pdf manual within this folder that describes the installation of GUI and how to use it. Also, please ensure to download and add to your Matlab path the latest version of OME formats (bfmatlab.zip) from the page: https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.5.0/
